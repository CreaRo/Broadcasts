Broadcasts!

A way to broadcast information to a group of people within an organizaition or university - in the easiest possible way.

Built this for my university to make it easier to get notified on upcoming events by the various special interest groups and clubs, lecture information by professors, and notifications by the administration. Currently, all information is conveyed by an emailing system called webmail hosted by Zimbra, which just sucks. (I'm sorry. But it really does. - Ive made an app for it as well, but I really felt the need for an app like Broadcasts.) 

Implemented and Used: 
1. Android Studio for the Android app
2. Python Flask for webserver, working on SQLAlchemy. (Shouldve stuck with MongoDB. Wouldve been much easier)
3. GCM for sending broadcasts. (Do not use my GCM key, please :P)
4. Need to work on website frontend
